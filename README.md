## Open-Eye-Sight: Multi-Camera and Video Perception

I design and implement **Open-Eye-Sight**, an initiative dedicated to **efficiently** run search entities and events on the video by textual description/image. 
Open-Eye-Sight aims to provide open-source solution for multi-camera semantic and image search problem and try out the capabilities of 
modern vision models. My method is capable of finding the objects and events over custom time interval on the video/multi-camera stream by using textual description or target image.

## ðŸ“° News

## Installation

### Install from Source

For CUDA 12.1, you can install the dependencies with the following commands. Otherwise, please refer to [TODO](TODO) for more instructions on different cuda version, and additional dependency.

```bash
# create a virtual env and activate (conda as an example)
conda create -n camera_search python=3.12.4
conda activate camera_search

# download the repo
git clone https://github.com/experiments-lain/Open-Eye-Sight
cd Open-Eye-Sight

# install required libraries (torch, torchvision, ultralytics and xformers)
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt # TODO TODO TODO
```
